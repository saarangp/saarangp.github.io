<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I'm Saarang, a 5th year PhD candidate at UCLA advised by Dr. William Speier. I focus on using deep learning to better understand the brain (and sometimes vice versa). At UCLA I'm asking 3 main questions: 

1. Can we develop a foundation model for EEG that can be useful for clinical applications? 
2. Can we uncover how seizures are modulated? 
3. Can we use deep learning to identify  biomarkers and treatment protocols for epilepsy accordingly? 
<!-- 4. something about PD here -->

I'm also interested in more fundamental questions about neuroscience, like "how does the brain process information?". This year, I spent 6 months in London interning with the amazing BrainAI team at Meta's FAIR, where I worked on developing new ways of answering this question (paper coming soon!). 

Additional about mes in case you made it this far and are still curious: 

I'm also a huge Arsenal fan (2nd again...), I like noodling on a piano or singing indian classical music, taking pictures of plants (@plantchavati), and I'm trying to run more half marathons. I'm also a huge history nerd ([current favorite podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/0sBh58hSTReUQiK4axYUVx))Â
